								<h3>Purpose</h3>
								The purpose of this application is to act as a program checker for a generic C-style
								language. Upon receiving a given program, the program checker parses the program
								and computes the formulas that need to be proven true so that the program can
								be determined to be valid.
								
								<h3>Workflow</h3>
								For most programs to be checked by the program checker, it is simply necessary to
								provide a precondition, the program itself, and a postcondition (More on preconditions
								and postconditions in the following section). Clicking on the <strong>Submit</strong> button will
								send the information to the program checker which will then verify and check the code.
								Once this is done, the program checker will return its results. One of two things will
								happen in this case.
								
								<h4>The program is invalid</h4>
								There will be an error displayed in the <strong>Proofs</strong> section indicating that the program
								contains a syntax error. To help correct your code, please refer to the <strong>Program</strong> section
								of the instructions.
								
								<h4>The program is valid</h4>
								The formulas needed to prove the validity of the program, given in propositional logic,
								will be displayed in the <strong>Proofs</strong> section. Please note that some of these proofs may be
								impossible to prove depending on the structure of the program and on the given precondition
								and postcondition. It is up to the user to ensure that the pre- and postconditions are strong
								enough to help complete the proofs.

							<div class="panel-body">
								The precondition and postcondition fields are used to specify what the program requires
								to function correctly and what properties it guarantees that its output will have.
								
								<h3>Precondition</h3>
								The precondition is required for telling the program checker what the written program
								needs to have guaranteed so that the program can then guarantee its own output. The
								precondition can be anything the user wants, however for the program checker to be able
								to properly manipulate it, it should be specified in propositional logic.
								
								<h3>Postcondition</h3>
								The postcondition is required for telling the program checker what the written program
								guarantees that its output will hold the properties specified in the postcondition. Again, the
								postcondition can be anything the user wants, however for the program checker to be able
								to properly manipulate it, it should be specified in propositional logic.
								
								<h3>Syntax</h3>
								As previously mentioned, the pre- and postconditions can take any user input, however the
								program checker can only manipulate them if they are specified in propositional logic. The
								reason that the user has the freedom to specify anything is that it is sometimes useful for
								the pre- and postconditions to specify complex or unique mathematic formulas. So, instead
								of restricting the options, it was decided to give the user some freedom at the expense of
								rigid validation. The user may therefore be able to specify any mathematical function or
								expression of its choice, like x&nbsp;=&nbsp;f(y) or g!&nbsp;>&nbsp;sqrt(f!).
								
								<h4>Symbols</h4>
								Some symbols are recognized by the program checker. These symbols are output by the checker
								in a way that makes them easier to read. The symbols that are recognized by the program checker
								are the following:
								<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
									<caption>List of symbols recognized by the program checker</caption>
									<thead>
										<tr>
											<th>Group</th>
											<th>Symbol</th>
											<th>Program Checker Output</th>
										</tr>
									</thead>

									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<th rowspan="4">Propositional Logic</th>
											<td>-></td>
											<td>→</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>/\</td>
											<td>∧</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>\/</td>
											<td>∨</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>~</td>
											<td>¬</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<th rowspan="3">Mathematical</th>
											<td>>=</td>
											<td>≥</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td><=</td>
											<td>≤</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>!=</td>
											<td>≠</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
								Any other symbols will be printed the same way as they were written in the pre- and
								postcondition input boxes. For example, if the formula x&nbsp;=&nbsp;(y&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)
								is written in the precondition box, then it will be output the same way by the checker.

								The program to be checked by the program checker must be written in the program
								text area. This is the code that will be analyzed by the checker and from which
								the formulas whose validity needs to be proven are generated.
								
								<h3>Syntax</h3>
								<h4>BNF Notation</h4>
								For quick reference, the program syntax follows the BNF notation described in chapter 4
								of <em>Logic in Computer Science</em> by Michael Huth and Mark Ryan, second edition, on pages
								260 - 261. In short, the context-free grammar accepted by the checker is the following:
								
								<div class="well">
									E ::= n | x | (-E) | (E + E) | (E - E) | (E * E)<br>
									B ::= true | false | (!B) | (B & B) | (B || B) | (E &lt; E)<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (E &gt; E) | (E &lt;= E) | (E &gt;= E) | (E == E) | (E != E)<br>
									C ::= x = E | C; C | if B {C} else {C} | while B {C}
								</div>
								
								Where E is an expression, B is a boolean expression, and C is a command.
								
								<h4>Details</h4>
								The syntax of the program, to be accepted by the program checker, must follow
								a generic C syntax. One of the most notable differences is that compound expressions
								must be written between parentheses. This means that mathematical operations like multiplication
								must be written like the following: ((x&nbsp;*&nbsp;y)&nbsp;+&nbsp;3) and not
								x&nbsp;*&nbsp;y&nbsp;+&nbsp;3. Another fairly large difference is that the checker does
								not support function definitions.
